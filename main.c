 * @section DESCRIPTION
 * 
 * This is an C implementation of Barabasi Albert algorithm coded by Rilder
 * Pires in 2013/08/30. The original idea of this algorithm was proposed by
 * Barabasi and Albert in 1999. It was decribed into a paper called
 * "Emergence of Scaling in Random Networks".
 *
 * Any feedback is very welcome.
