 * @section DESCRIPTION
 * 
 * Adaptation of Mersenne Twister Pseudo Random Number Generator. The original
 * C-program for MT19937, with initialization improved 2002/1/26 was coded by
 * Takuji Nishimura and Makoto Matsumoto. This adaptation was coded by Rilder
 * Pires in 2013/08/22.
 * 
 * Any feedback is very welcome.
